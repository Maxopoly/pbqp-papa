/**
 * Tries every possible combination to calculate a perfect solution
 *
 * We attempt to do so with the minimal amount of work, which we ideally do by only
 * recalculating the part of the graph that changed compared to the previous iteration.
 *
 * This leads us to a counter where every digit refers to a node in the graph. Each of these digits/nodes
 * can have a possible value within [0,VectorDegree) where VectorDegree is the length of the cost Vector
 * associated with the node. For example for 4 nodes, each with a Vector length of 3, we would count:
 * [0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 1], [0 0 0 2], [0 0 1 0], .... , [2 2 2 2]
 *
 * The problem with this are the cascading changes when higher indexed digits change, for example here:
 * [0 1 1 1] --> [1 0 0 0]. We need to recalculate the cost for the entire graph here, because the entire
 * selection changed!
 *
 * To sidestep this problem, we are not just going to count up the way we know it from binary, but instead
 * we use an adapted version of the Gray code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code)
 *
 *
 * By remembering the previous total cost and knowing which node we just changed the selection for in our gray code,
 * we only need to recalculate one node and all of its incident edges per iteration/solution.
