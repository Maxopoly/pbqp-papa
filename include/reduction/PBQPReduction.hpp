 * Simplifies a PBQP by removing a part of it.
 *
 * A reduction takes a good look at a PBQP to determine a subset A of the PBQP P, where P could be solved perfectly,
 * if a solution for P \ A was known. The reduction removes A from P and passes P \ A on to further reductions or a solver.
 *
 * Later on a solution for P \ A is given to the reduction instance and the instance is expected to add to the solution,
 * so it solves P completly
 *
 * The overall goal here is to simplify the PBQP for the final solving step, how exactly that is achieved is completly up
 * to the implementation. Adding/removing nodes, adding/removing edges and modifying cost matrices/vektors is all allowed.
